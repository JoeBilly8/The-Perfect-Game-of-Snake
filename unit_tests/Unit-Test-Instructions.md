# Instructions for running the unit tests in this directory

_NOTE_ The unit tests have been placed in this folder for ease of location for the markers purposes, they WILL NOT work running in this folder (due to python path issues with referencing parent directories) therefore if you wish to run and test them, then move whichever ones you want to run to the parent folder where "snake_main.py" is located.

These unit tests use the standard python "unittest" library so obviously if you wish to run them you will need both python (3.9 minimum) and the unittest library installed.

Thanks :)
