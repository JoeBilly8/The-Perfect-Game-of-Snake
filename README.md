# The-Perfect-Game-of-Snake

### A repository for the development of my final year undergraduate project where I create multiple AI to play "the perfect game of snake".

## Instructions

- To run the main game, simply run "snake_main.py".

* To edit the settings without doing it in-game (i.e for the snake_testing_cycle function) then change these in "snake_settings.py".

* To run the testing cycle function, simply run "snake_testing_cycle.py" (change however many cycles you want to run within the code).

* Note: You will need python 3.9 and pygame installed to run this project.

* Please reach out to "Joe Moore" (sgjmoor4@liverpool.ac.uk) if you need any further help running the game.
